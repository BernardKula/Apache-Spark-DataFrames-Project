# Introduction To Spark

## Background Information
As a Data professional, you need to perform an analysis by answering questions about
some stock market data on Safaricom from the years 2012-2017.<br />

You will need to perform the following:<br />
###### Data Importation and Exploration<br />
● Start a spark session and load the stock file while inferring the data types.<br />
● Determine the column names<br />
● Make observations about the schema.<br />
● Show the first 5 rows<br />
● Use the describe method to learn about the data frame<br />
###### Data Preparation<br />
● Format all the data to 2 decimal places i.e. format_number()<br />
● Create a new data frame with a column called HV Ratio that is the ratio of the
High Price versus volume of stock traded for a day<br />
###### Data Analysis<br />
● What day had the Peak High in Price?<br />
● What is the mean of the Close column?<br />
● What is the max and min of the Volume column?<br />
● How many days was the Close lower than 60 dollars?<br />
● What percentage of the time was the High greater than 80 dollars?<br />
● What is the Pearson correlation between High and Volume?<br />
● What is the max High per year?<br />
● What is the average Close for each Calendar Month?<br />
